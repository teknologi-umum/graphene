Hello and thank you for your interest on submitting a PR to this repository!

First and foremost, I hope you have read the CONTRIBUTING.md file.
If not, you can find it here: https://github.com/teknologi-umum/bot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

I would let you know that if you submit a PR without opening up an issue first,
your PR might be rejected by the maintainers and we don't want you to waste
your precious time to work on something that's not going to be used :)

If you think you can go ahead without opening up an issue, please explain changes about your PR
in as much detail as possible.

Here is a few checklist that act as a reminder for your PR:
- [ ] I've opened a Github issue beforehand
- [ ] I've explained my PR in as much detail as possible.
- [ ] I've added test files for new features.

After everything's complete, you can delete this placeholder text. Again, thank you!
